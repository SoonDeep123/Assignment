			language. when I enrolled in the course there is a subject of web development then I started

		<h2>Assignment</h2>
		<p> As I received my assignment on 12th feb 2022, I became nervous, how to start. And 
			there are many rules and regulations to follow. And there are many forbidden to do.
			And I saw many site on the net. So that, on 14th feb 2022 I made my webpage layout design on my copy first.
			Then, on 15th feb 2022 I started coding on my laptop. And first I made Navbar, then I started slowly. And 
			I faced many problems at the time of coding. There was a main problem at the time of making 
			responsive hamburger icon. I used many colors on the navbar randomly, then finally I choosed purple
			on the navbar. In the Same way I choosed aqua color in the background and gray on the body. The 
			combination of that colors make my webpage fit and fine.
			And successfully I finished my assignment on 4th march 2022.
